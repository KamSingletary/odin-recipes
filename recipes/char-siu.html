    <h3>The Perfect Pork</h3>
      <p>
        Easily recognized by its distinctive red color and famous for it’s sweet and salty flavor with a hint of spice, char siu pork, also known as Chinese BBQ pork, is a much-loved dish that’s easier to make than you might think! Trust me, the hardest part about this recipe is waiting for it to roast in the oven!
      </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Brown Sugar</li>
        <li>Shoyu</li>
        <li>Hoisin Sauce</li>
        <li>Sherry</li>
        <li>Beet Powder</li>
        <li>Sesame Oil</li>
        <li>Chinese Five Spice</li>
        <li>Pork Butt</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Add the garlic, brown sugar, shoyu, hoisin sauce, sherry, food coloring, sesame oil, and Chinese five spice to a bowl and mix well. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Trim away any large chunks of fat and cut the pork into about 1-inch long strips.</li>
        <li>Place the pork into a large zipper-top bag and pour the char siu marinade over the top and gently massage the meat and sauce until they’re combined. Refrigerate and marinate overnight.</li>
        <li>Bring the pork to room temperature before cooking.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 425-F.</li>
        <li>Place an oven-safe wire rack over the top of a baking sheet. Remove the pork from the marinade, letting the excess drip off. Put the pork onto the rack. Add about ¼ cup of water to the baking sheet, which will help create steam and will prevent the pork drippings from burning.</li>
        <li>Baste with the extra marinade every 15-20 minutes. A silicone brush works wonders for this, or you can just spoon it over the top.</li>
        <li>Bake for 50-60 minutes or until the pork has an internal temperature of 145-F.</li>
        <li>If you’d like more caramelization, put the broiler on low, and broil the pork for about 5 minutes at the end of cooking, but don’t walk away or it could burn.</li>
        <li>Let the meat rest for 10 minutes, slice horizontally into thin strips, and enjoy!</li>
      </ol>
